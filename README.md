# Live camera detection with YOLO

This project uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection, identifying people and various everyday objects using either a connected USB camera or the deviceâ€™s built-in webcam.

## Features
- Real-time object detection  
- Lightweight YOLOv8n model for fast performance  
- Works on CPU or GPU  
- Simple configuration for frame size, confidence threshold, and FPS 

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher  
- pip  
- A working webcam (USB or built-in)  
- Optionally, a CUDA-capable GPU for faster inference  

### Installing

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install ultralytics opencv-python pyautogui torch

### Executing program

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yolo-live-detection.git
